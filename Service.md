### ‚úÖ **Service** (Kubernetes Component)

- A **Service** is a built-in **Kubernetes component**.
- Its job is to provide a **stable way to access a set of Pods**, even if Pods are created or destroyed.
- It also **load balances** traffic between those Pods.


---

### üìÑ **Service Resource** (YAML File)

- The **Service Resource** is the **YAML configuration file** that tells Kubernetes **how to create and configure a Service**.
    
- It includes:
    
    - **Selectors** to find the target Pods
    - **Ports** for communication
    - The **type** (ClusterIP, NodePort, etc.) to define how it‚Äôs exposed

### üîÑ Together:

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Service**|The actual **Kubernetes object** that routes traffic to Pods|
|**Service Resource**|The **YAML file** that defines the rules for that Service|

---

So your understanding is absolutely correct:

> ‚úÖ **"Service is a Kubernetes component. Service Resource is a YAML config that defines rules to access the Pods."**




```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80 # Exposed by the service (this is what Ingress talks to)
      targetPort: 8080 # Port inside the pod where the app is actually running
  type: ClusterIP       # Default type (internal communication)

```



| Part                         | What it means                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiVersion: v1`             | Using the core v1 API group                                                                              |
| `kind: Service`              | This is a Service object                                                                                 |
| `metadata.name: app-service` | Name of the Service ‚Äî must match what you use in `ingress.yaml` under `backend.service.name`             |
| `selector.app: my-app`       | The Service **selects Pods** with the label `app: my-app` ‚Äî so it knows which Pods to forward traffic to |
| `ports.port: 80`             | The port that the Service itself exposes (Ingress connects here)                                         |
| `ports.targetPort: 8080`     | The actual port **inside the Pods** (container) that handles the traffic                                 |
| `type: ClusterIP`            | This service is internal (default) ‚Äî accessed from within the cluster (like by an Ingress)               |


---

### üîÅ Flow Summary:

1. **User requests**: `http://example.com/app`
2. The **Ingress Controller** checks the rule: path `/app` ‚Üí `app-service`
3. It forwards the request to the **`app-service`**
4. The **Service** sends traffic to one of the matching **Pods**
