### üåê What is **Ingress**?

- **Ingress** is a **Kubernetes component** that helps manage **external access** to your **Services**, usually over **HTTP or HTTPS**.
- Think of it as a **smart entry point** into your cluster.

- It can handle:
    
    - URL routing (`/api` ‚Üí one service, `/blog` ‚Üí another)
    - Load balancing
    - SSL/TLS termination
    - Host-based routing (`app.example.com` vs `admin.example.com`)

---

### üìÑ What is an **Ingress Resource**?

- An **Ingress Resource** is a **YAML configuration file** that defines **rules** for how incoming traffic should be routed to your services.


### üëá In your `ingress.yaml`:

```yaml


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /app
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app-service
                port:
                  number: 80

```

This part means:
- "Send traffic to the **Kubernetes Service** named `app-service`."
- The `app-service` is **already defined** in a `service.yaml`.
- That Service handles the **actual connection to the right Pods** (using `selector` labels).


This means:
- If someone visits `example.com/app`, Kubernetes will send them to the `app-service`.

### üß† Key Point: Ingress ‚â† LoadBalancer

|Concept|What it does|
|---|---|
|**Service (LoadBalancer)**|Exposes **one** service with a public IP. Simple.|
|**Ingress**|Exposes **many services** under **one IP** or domain, and can route based on **paths or hostnames**. Flexible.|

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Ingress Controller (Important!)

- The **Ingress Resource** defines _what_ should happen.
- But you also need an **Ingress Controller** running in the cluster (like **NGINX**, **Traefik**, or **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**) to actually _do_ the routing.
    

Without an Ingress Controller, the Ingress Resource does nothing.
* You need to **install and run an Ingress Controller** in your cluster ‚Äî  
  Kubernetes does **not** include one by default.



### üõ† Common Ingress Controllers

- **NGINX Ingress Controller** (most popular for on-prem and general use)
- **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** (for Amazon EKS)
- **Traefik** (lightweight, fast, supports modern features)
- **HAProxy**, **Istio Gateway**, etc.

The Ingress Controller does the job of load balancing and routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic inside a Kubernetes cluster.
