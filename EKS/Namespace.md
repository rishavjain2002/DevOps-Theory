Namespaces are a logical grouping of Kubernetes resources
### Think of it like this:

- A **namespace** is like a folder that organizes resources inside the cluster.
- A **node** is a physical or virtual machine that runs your workloads.
- A **pod** belongs to a namespace and is **scheduled to run on a node**, but the **namespace itself has nothing to do with the node.**



Let’s say you have:

- A cluster with 3 nodes
- A namespace called `game-2048`
- A Deployment in `game-2048` creating 5 Pods

What happens?

- Kubernetes scheduler places those Pods **on any available node**, based on resource availability.
- All 5 Pods belong to the `game-2048` namespace, **regardless of which node they end up on.**

A `deployment.yaml` (or any Kubernetes resource file) is **always associated with a namespace**, whether:

- **Explicitly**: via `metadata.namespace`
- **Implicitly**: via the default namespace (`default`), if you don’t specify one
